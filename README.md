Matthew
   <p> The **Gospel** according to Matthew</p>

Q- What Gospel?

<p> Summary </p>
{1:1} → {1:17} - Generation of our Lord Jesus Christ

{1:18} → {1:25} - How Jesus was born, based on prophecy and how he got his name JESUS; Mary and Joseph lived and were espoused in Bethlehem of Judaea.

1, Matt starts by saying: {1:1} The book of the **generation** of Jesus Christ, the **son** of David, the **son** of Abraham.

Q- Observe carefully, why did Matt begin his writing this way, is there a particular purpose to it or it's a Jewish custom?

2, Notice that the "last" connected person to Abraham and David is Joseph, and Joseph did not directly give birth (is not the father of Jesus) to Jesus yet he's connected to Joseph's ancestors as a Son

Q- Why so?

3, Q- What is the "carrying away into Babylon" Matt highlights, must be a key significant history

4,Observe carefully from vs.18 → 25: Joseph had not "touched" her when he found that she was pregnant, so he thought to divorce her privily and not make her a publick example (he thought Mary was promiscuous), he thinking about these things, behold **the** (specific) angel (messenger) of the lord appeared to him in a dream, and did two things to him- 
    1, Calmed him/Settled his thoughts in a {Statement|Reason} (fear not to take unto thee Mary thy wife: for that which is conceived in her is of the Holy Ghost.)
    2, Gave him an instruction in a {Statement|Reason} manner (...thou shalt call his name JESUS: for he shall save his people from their sins.)

Q - Who is this angel of the Lord that appeared unto Joseph in a dream in vs.20, given the article (the) was used to describe the angel, it must be a specific/unique/peculiar angel?

Q - Why did Matt use the prophecy to describe the birth of Jesus in vs 22→23 since Jesus wasn't actually named Emmanuel as prophesied ({1:22} Now all this was done, that it might be fulfilled which was spoken of the Lord by the prophet, saying, {1:23} Behold, a virgin shall be with child, and shall bring forth a son, and they shall call his name Emmanuel, which being interpreted is, God with us.)?
